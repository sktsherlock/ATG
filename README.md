MAGB is a project to share the public multimodal attributed graph (MAG) datasets and benchmark the performance of the different baseline methods.
We welcome more to share datasets that are valuable for MAGs research.


## Datasets ðŸ””
We collect and construct 5 MAG datasets from Amazon and Reddit.

[//]: # (Now you can go to the 'Files and version' in [MAG]&#40;https://huggingface.co/Sherirto/MAG&#41; to find the datasets we upload!)

[//]: # (You can use the node initial feature we created, and you also can extract the node feature from our code. )

[//]: # (For a more detailed and clear process, please [clik there.ðŸ˜Ž]&#40;FeatureExtractor/README.md&#41;)
[//]: # (In each dataset folder, you can find the **csv** file &#40;which save the text attribute of the dataset&#41;, **pt** file &#40;which represent the dgl graph file&#41;, and the **Feature** folder &#40;which save the text embedding we extract from the PLM&#41;.)
